        This exhibit is about materializing my own fascinations around blackness and its lack of visibility in net art. A sub-genre sunken into Vimeo pages and Tumblr threads. I am hoping that this will get us to think about the pieces that aren’t made so accessible to net artwork databases!
        <br>
        <br>
        This exhibit is meant to display of the unprescribed appearances of black art, the visuals that are not as well noticed or acknowledged enough of the time. With visuals that refrain from being modeled in a concise and direct call to action. Ones that require us to look, revisit, and still not understand. There are so many perspectives and voices, but it always baffles me how black artists are expected to encapsulate their work around guided formulas. Their works must push the brink by touching the painfully dragged out ‘black experience’. A phrase that doesn’t truly coincide with reality. 
        <br>
        <br>
        My goal with this exhibit is to showcase the impossibilities in there being one voice or collective experience of blackness. My hope for this exhibit is to bring to the surface how there are so many mediums to black art; not solely in where the artists devote their concentration. This is about the identities, styles and practices that can’t settle as plastic replicated messages. Here, works radiating the unusual are the blueprint. All the artworks I have arranged to be shown were created in the twenty-first century with black artists behind every piece.
        <br>
        <br>
        The three individual artworks that were carefully selected are from the mind of a black artist creating solely digital or physical artworks that can be pleasantly viewed through a screen. These artworks are meant to be the catalysts to questions around the lines of why so many net artists of color are left out of the conversation. They aren’t meant to be the answers.

        While writing this I thought about a quote from Shawné Michaeleain Holloway:
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>“Now I am having mixed feelings about net art. Because I see how the strategies of black culture, taken and developed by white net artists and institutions are now used by corporations and in politics.”</p></i>
