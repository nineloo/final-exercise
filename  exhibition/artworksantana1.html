    <p class="descripton"><i>Black Bieber, 2014</i></p>
    <p class="descripton">If you were ever wondering how it feels to see your culture commercialized, this GIF tells it all. Created by RaFia Santana under their tag name “RaFia” in 2014, Santana combines a color whirlwind with the face of a youthful Justin Bieber. The visuals of Santana’s image dance around the magazine category with a magenta headline “Enforcer” to drive the message along. <i>Black Bieber</i> addresses how standards in black culture are too often up for grabs. A flattened bright pink durag (a staple in the black haircare world) is dawned on Justin Bieber's head, with a duo of shiny cuban linked chains accessorizing a harmful trope. This image not only registers Santana’s frustration with pop culture using ‘blackness’ to push the opposite faces ahead. It displays the façade in action; especially when a gradient flash switches Bieber’s white skin to a chestnut brown.</p>

    <p class="descripton"><i>#PAYBLACKTIME, 2016 - present</i></p>
    <p class="descripton">This ongoing project that began abruptly after the 2016 presidential election of the United States addresses how art is not only a political tool. It can become an act of support for people left our of the conversation. 
        <i>#PAYBLACKTIME</i> opperated as a money transferring service that requested financial donations from White Americans. In return, those donations would be carried over into a fund to provide meals for black and brown communities. 
        Santana’s incredibly unique online project arrived when white supremacy in America was resurrecting to a horrifying degree. It provided space for people of color to uproot the platforms in favor of the presidential administration like Facebook and PayPal.</p>
