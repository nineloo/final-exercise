    <p class="descripton">In a 7x7 inch digital image where its file format remains undefined, Shawné Michaelain Holloway transfers images of herself across a four by four panel.  Holloway’s manipulation of a single image speaks to how she is able to define a world through a single visual.
         In hazy monochromatic flash-on portrait where multiples of her face arrange themselves in a minuscule scale in each column. 
         While no description is paired with Holloway’s work, black visibility in net art is a strong theme to build upon here. The intricate practices in visual design that reflect In other works by Holloway. They weave into her comment on the net artists who are not black that reclaim styles from black artists as their own.
